	<h1>Gender Equality</h1>
	
	<p>Gender equality is where both men and women share the same right and opportunities in different sections of society like economics, academics and decision making. 
	It is also where both men and women are accepted not because of their sex but because of their behaviour and aspirations.
	To simply put it, men and women are equally valued and respected.</p>
	<br>
	<p>
	The school has no specific programs focusing on gender equality but the school practices equality by not stopping a student from enrolling a course just because of their gender.
	All services that the school offers, caters to both men and women where in that sense, gender equality is already promoted. 
	As a catholic school, the school has already adjusted in terms of the LGBT community. 
	The school doesnâ€™t stop the students in expressing their selves as long as no rules are broken.
