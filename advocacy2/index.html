	<h2> Gender Equality according to the Guidance Center </h2>
	<p>Gender equality is where both men and women share the same right and opportunities in different sections of society like economics, academics and decision making. 
	It is also where both men and women are accepted not because of their sex but because of their behaviour and aspirations.
	To simply put it, men and women are equally valued and respected.</p>
	
	<h2> SLU Guidance Center's insight on Gender Equality </h2>
	<p>
	SLU has no specific programs focusing on gender equality but the school practices equality by allowing a student to enroll a specific course despite of their gender. 
	i.e Engineering is not only for males but also for females
	All services that the school offers, caters to both men and women and in that sense, gender equality is already promoted. 
	
	<h2> The "Third Gender" or The LGBT Community </h2>
	As a catholic school, the school has already adjusted in terms of the LGBT community. 
	The school doesnâ€™t stop the students in expressing their selves as long as no rules are broken.
